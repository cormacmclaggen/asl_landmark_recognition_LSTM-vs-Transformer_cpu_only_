# asl_landmark_recognition_cpu_only_LSTMvsTrasformer
Comparative study of BiLSTM vs Transformer for MediaPipe-based ASL sign recognition on CPU/edge devices.
This repository contains code and experiments for real-time isolated American Sign Language (ASL) recognition using MediaPipe Holistic landmarks. We compare a BiLSTM baseline and a lightweight Transformer encoder on a 20-class ASL dataset under CPU-only constraints, focusing on accuracy, parameter efficiency, and training time for edge deployment.
